# Skigammon
50s skiing and drinking game.

This is a game that a friend had and was fun to play after skiing all day.
I made one copy and it turned out well.

The money and cards are pretty straight forward to make. Print on color paper and cut along the dotted lines

The board is a little harder and requires printing the layout on a C-size color plotter.

Box is optional.

I used a laser cutter on the tokens to first raster the image then cut the shapes. 

A 3d printer is handy for making the tokens.

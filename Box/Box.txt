The overal size of the box base was 11.125 x 17.5 x .75
The overal size of the box lid was 11.125 x 17.5 x .25
I carved out the compartments for the pieces and other items by hand. Laborous. Be nice to CNC it.

The box base was made from layered double-wall cardboard and painted black.
Tape hinge was from the same black painters masking tape.

Single sided black velcro strips were glued to the box using leftover rtv.

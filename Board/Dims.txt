Original board was 4 puzzle pieces. I didnt want to try to make that.

I scanned and each piece then spent an afternoon touching up and combining the graphics using GIMP.

I used a C-Size printer to print the colored graphics.

The board is made out of layered press board. I'd probably make it out of one layer of thin wood
next time. 

The hinge I made out of black acid free painters tape 1" wide.
I followed this guys video roughly from DIY gaming

The board came out to be 20" x 16.75".
